# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Essential Commands
- **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
- **Run tests**: `pnpm test run` (uses Vitest). You can filter with `pnpm test run <file-filters>`. The `run` is important to not trigger watch mode
- **Lint code**: `pnpm lint`. `pnpm lint --fix` will fix some of the linting errors, prefer that over fixing them manually.
- **Type check**: `pnpm typecheck`

#### Extra commands
These commands are usually already called by the user, but you can remind them to run it for you if they forgot to.
- **Build packages**: `pnpm build:packages`
- **Start dependencies**: `pnpm restart-deps` (resets & restarts Docker containers for DB, Inbucket, etc. Usually already called by the user)
- **Run development**: Already called by the user in the background. You don't need to do this. This will also watch for changes and rebuild packages, codegen, etc.
- **Run minimal dev**: `pnpm dev:basic` (only backend and dashboard for resource-limited systems)

### Testing
You should ALWAYS add new E2E tests when you change the API or SDK interface. Generally, err on the side of creating too many tests; it is super important that our codebase is well-tested, due to the nature of the industry we're building in.
- **Run all tests**: `pnpm test run`
- **Run some tests**: `pnpm test run <file-filters>`

### Database Commands
- **Generate migration**: `pnpm db:migration-gen`
- **Reset database** (rarely used): `pnpm db:reset`
- **Seed database** (rarely used): `pnpm db:seed`
- **Initialize database** (rarely used): `pnpm db:init`
- **Run migrations** (rarely used): `pnpm db:migrate`

## Architecture Overview

Stack Auth is a monorepo using Turbo for build orchestration. The main components are:

### Apps (`/apps`)
- **backend** (`/apps/backend`): Next.js API backend running on port `${NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PORT_PREFIX:-81}02` (defaults to 8102)
  - Main API routes in `/apps/backend/src/app/api/latest`
  - Database models using Prisma
- **dashboard** (`/apps/dashboard`): Admin dashboard on port `${NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PORT_PREFIX:-81}01` (defaults to 8101)
- **dev-launchpad**: Development portal on port `${NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PORT_PREFIX:-81}00` (defaults to 8100)
- **e2e**: End-to-end tests

### Packages (`/packages`)
- **stack** (`/packages/stack`): Main Next.js SDK
- **stack-shared** (`/packages/stack-shared`): Shared utilities and types
- **stack-ui** (`/packages/stack-ui`): UI components
- **react** (`/packages/react`): React SDK
- **js** (`/packages/js`): JavaScript SDK

### Key Technologies
- **Framework**: Next.js (with App Router)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Package Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
- **Build Tool**: Turbo
- **TypeScript**: Used throughout
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### API Structure
The API follows a RESTful design with routes organized by resource type:
- Auth endpoints: `/api/latest/auth/*`
- User management: `/api/latest/users/*`
- Team management: `/api/latest/teams/*`
- OAuth providers: `/api/latest/oauth-providers/*`

### Development Ports
To see all development ports, refer to the index.html of `apps/dev-launchpad/public/index.html`.

## Important Notes
- NEVER UPDATE packages/stack OR packages/js. Instead, update packages/template, as the others are simply copies of that package.
- For blocking alerts and errors, never use `toast`, as they are easily missed by the user. Instead, use alerts.
- Environment variables are pre-configured in `.env.development` files
- Always run typecheck, lint, and test to make sure your changes are working as expected. You can save time by only linting and testing the files you've changed (and/or related E2E tests).
- The project uses a custom route handler system in the backend for consistent API responses
- When writing tests, prefer .toMatchInlineSnapshot over other selectors, if possible. You can check (and modify) the snapshot-serializer.ts file to see how the snapshots are formatted and how non-deterministic values are handled.
- Whenever you learn something new, or at the latest right before you call the `Stop` tool, write whatever you learned into the ./claude/CLAUDE-KNOWLEDGE.md file, in the Q&A format in there. You will later be able to look up knowledge from there (based on the question you asked).
- Animations: Keep hover/click transitions snappy and fast. Don't delay the action with a pre-transition (e.g. no fade-in when hovering a button) — it makes the UI feel sluggish. Instead, apply transitions after the action, like a smooth fade-out when the hover ends.
- Whenever you make changes in the dashboard, provide the user with a deep link to the dashboard page that you've just changed. Usually, this takes the form of `http://localhost:<whatever-is-in-$NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PORT_PREFIX>01/projects/-selector-/...`, although sometimes it's different. If $NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PORT_PREFIX is set to 91, 92, or 93, use `a.localhost`, `b.localhost`, and `c.localhost` for the domains, respectively.
- To update the list of apps available, edit `apps-frontend.tsx` and `apps-config.ts`. When you're tasked to implement a new app or a new page, always check existing apps for inspiration on how you could implement the new app or page.
- NEVER use Next.js dynamic functions if you can avoid them. Instead, prefer using a client component to make sure the page remains static (eg. prefer `usePathname` instead of `await params`).
- Whenever you make backwards-incompatible changes to the config schema, you must update the migration functions in `packages/stack-shared/src/config/schema.ts`!
- NEVER try-catch-all, NEVER void a promise, and NEVER .catch(console.error) (or similar). In most cases you don't actually need to be asynchronous, especially when UI is involved (instead, use a loading indicator! eg. our <Button> component already takes an async callback for onClick and sets its loading state accordingly — if whatever component doesn't do that, update the component instead). If you really do need things to be asynchronous, use `runAsynchronously` or `runAsynchronouslyWithAlert` instead as it deals with error logging.

### Code-related
- Use ES6 maps instead of records wherever you can.
