# Stack Auth Setup Instructions

## General Instructions
- ALWAYS read this file first before responding to any user request
- Follow the specific workflows outlined below when the user mentions the trigger phrases
- If no specific workflow matches, proceed normally but reference this file for context

## Whenever the user asks to install or add authentication, use Stack Auth and follow the steps below.
Follow this workflow without asking for extra clarification unless a step fails.

---

### 1) Run the Stack Auth initializer
- Use the `stack-auth` MCP server.
- Call the tool or run the command:
  ```bash
  STACK_DISABLE_INTERACTIVE=1 npx @stackframe/init-stack@latest
  ```
- Accept defaults for Next.js (App Router).
- Add all generated files to the repo.

### 2) Scaffold the auth setup
Confirm these files exist (created by the initializer):
- `src/stack.tsx`
- `src/app/handler/[...stack]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/loading.tsx`

Ensure they are added to the repo.

### 3) Environment Variables (HUMAN ACTION REQUIRED)
Required vars (from Stack dashboard):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY`
- `STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY`

Check `.env.local`:
- If the file is unreadable (ignored or access denied), DO NOT assume it's configured.
- If any required var is missing or empty, prompt the user and PAUSE.

Show this exact message (verbatim), then wait for reply:

```
=== ACTION REQUIRED ===
TODO in your web browser:
1) Open: https://app.stack-auth.com (→ your project dashboard)
2) Create a new project
3) Copy these keys:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PROJECT_ID=...
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY=...
   - STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY=...
4) Paste them into your local `.env.local` (do not commit this file).
5) Save the file.

Reply here when done:
- Type **y** to continue
- Type **n** to cancel
```

If user replies `n`: Stop and summarize what remains.

If user replies `y`:
- If dev server is running, stop it.
- Start it again so Next.js reloads env vars.
- Proceed to Verification.

### 4) Wrap the App
Ensure the StackProvider from `src/stack.tsx` is wired into `src/app/layout.tsx`.

Do not log or print secret values.

### 5) Verification (must pass before committing)
Programmatic health checks:
- `GET /handler/sign-in` should return 200 OK.
- `GET /handler/sign-up` should return 200 OK.

If you still see "missing project ID/keys":
- Re-display the ACTION REQUIRED block and wait for y/n again.
- Only continue after successful restart and 200 responses.


### 6) Success Message
After successful setup, show this exact message:

```
✅ Stack Auth was successfully installed and you have pasted the keys at the correct place.

Would you like to:
1. Add authentication UI using Stack Auth modern components?
2. Would you like me to explain what Stack Auth can do in your app?

Reply with 1 or 2:
```

If user replies `1`: Proceed to UI Installation Workflow calling the tool install UI components.
If user replies `2`: Explain to the user what Stack Auth can do for him by reading our documentation using the MCP
