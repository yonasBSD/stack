## Languages & Frameworks
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What languages are supported?">
    For frontends, Stack supports TypeScript and JavaScript. For backends, Stack has a flexible [REST API](/rest-api) that can be used with any language or framework.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Stack with other JavaScript frameworks, like Astro or Angular?">
    Yes! You can use our vanilla JavaScript SDK, or, if the framework is React-based, our React SDK.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Stack with the Next.js pages router?">
    Only the Next.js app router is currently officially supported, although some members of the community have successfully used the React or vanilla JavaScript SDKs with the pages router.
  </Accordion>

## Product
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do you compare to `<X>`?">
    Ask yourself about `<X>`:

    - Is `<X>` open-source?
    - Is `<X>` developer-friendly, well-documented, and lets you get started in minutes?
    - Besides authentication, does `<X>` also do authorization and user management (see feature list below)?
    
    If you answered "no" to any of these questions, then that's how Stack Auth is different from `<X>`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I migrate my existing userbase to Stack Auth?">
    Yes! You can [create users programmatically](/rest-api/server/users/create-user) using our [REST API](/rest-api).
  </Accordion>
